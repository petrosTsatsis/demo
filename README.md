This is CRM (Customer Relationship Management) Web Application. It has two parts, backend and frontend,
backend is implemented using Java 17, Springboot, Postgresql, Hibernate and authentication-authorization using JWT,
while the frontend part is implemented using React, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

If you want to download the project as a zip do not forget to rename the folder from "demo-main" to "demo" after extracting it
because we use docker compose with three different docker containers, one for the backend part, one for the frontend part and 
one for the postgresql database.
